# PaleoHD:High Resolution Paleoclimate Reconstructions

## Overview

PaleoHD is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and workflows designed to generate climate field reconstructions and downscale them to obtain high-resolution map of key environmental variables that can be used in agriculture modeling. 

The downscaling is achieved using deep learning methods, particularly, diffusion models.

## Feature

* Reproducible Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the workflow

* Tools for visualizing and evaluation climate field reconstructions and downscaled outputs.

* Integration with deep learning models

* Outputs tailored for agriculture modeling

## Getting started

To clone and explore the notebooks:

```
git clone https://github.com/khider/paleoHD.git
cd PaleoHD
```
